                    <h3> About Me</h3> 
                    <p>
                            My Name is Jessica. I have lived in 10 different states and have lived in a different
                            country for a year.
                            I enjoy way too many hobbies to have time for. Some of my favorites are: Plant keeping, ballroom dancing, horse
                            back riding, and knitting.
                            My biggest pet peeve is when people say they will do something then don't ever do it.
                            I have 2 fur-babies, 2 ragdoll cats and a betta fish

       <h3> Why coding school</h3>
       </div>
       <div> 
        <p>Deciding to go to coding school was kind of a spurr of the moment thing. I have a freind who attended Dev
            Mountain.
            He was constantly trying to get me to go to Dev Mountain and learn to code. But I always sneered at office
            jobs, especially those
            to do with computers. Always thought it was dumb and boring and I would hate life. But I have had a lot of
            jobs that were more physical
            labor. But I am getting old and tired and have hurt myself too many times. I felt I was working way too
            hard for such little pay.
            Finally I got my first "office" job working in a call center. I had to do some dinking around on a computer
            and I thought it was pretty cool.
            I went to a job fair where the Helio Training recruiter was and talked to him about the school and what
            coding was. He said classes started
            in two weeks. I figured, why the hell not. It would be a good expericence and getting into a new field
            would be a good change. And
            it sure would be nice to make a little more money. </p>
